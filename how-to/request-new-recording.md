Though the Chronologue is able to help you gather data on virtually infinite places at virtually infinite points in time, the telescope itself is very much a singular finite device and must therefore undergo a rigorous reservation process. People or organizations interested in utilizing the Chronologue for research purposes can fill out a form to request use of the technology. This form allows them to make their case for how the Chronologue would aid them and how any new knowledge unearthed in the discovery process will move humanity forward.

APPLY EARLY. The Chronologue project receives up to 1000 requests per week, so please allow us 6-8 weeks to make a decision.
